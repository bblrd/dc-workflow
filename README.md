## Project Goal

The goal of the final project is to use various tools and techniques covered in this course together in a small end-to-end data cleaning workflow.

### Project Phases

(1.) Overview and initial assessment - describe the structure and content of the dataset and quality issues discovered. Describe a use case of the dataset and derive data cleaning goals that can be achieved from this use. 
(2.) Data cleaning with OpenRefine - use [OpenRefine](openrefine.org) to clean the chosen dataset. Document the result in narrative and supplemental information. Quantify the results of our efforts along with provenance information from OpenRefine. 
(3.) Develop a relational database schema - identify the *logical integrity constraints* (ICs) after the data is loaded into a SQLite database. Check the ICs that we have identified.
(4.) Create a workflow model - used [YesWorkflow](https://github.com/yesworkflow-org) to create a workflow model for the project. Answered the following questions: what are the key inputs and outputs of workflow? What are the dependencies?

## The Data

The data used is New York Public Library's [collection of historical menus.](http://menus.nypl.org/) The collection includes about 45,000 menus from the 1840s to the present in the NYC area.
